# Standards

Defines **non-negotiable rules** that all Deevnet projects must follow.

## Scope

This section includes:

- [Naming conventions](naming/) - How systems and services are named
- [Correctness definitions](correctness/) - Infrastructure invariants
- [Identity vs Intent](identity-vs-intent/) - Separation of host identity from workload intent

If a project conflicts with standards, **standards win**.
