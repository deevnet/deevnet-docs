# Platforms Integration & Tooling

Documents how documentation and standards integrate into the developer workflow.

## Scope

This section includes:
- Submodule usage conventions
- Local AI tooling visibility and context
- Repo bootstrapping expectations
- Documentation discoverability requirements

This section ensures documentation is **present and usable**, not ornamental.
