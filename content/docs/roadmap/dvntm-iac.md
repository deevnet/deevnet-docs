# DVNTM Infrastructure Automation

Full automation of mobile substrate provisioning and management using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Configuration as Code (CaC) solutions.

- **GitHub:** https://github.com/deevnet
- **Documentation:** https://deevnet.github.io/deevnet-docs/

## Project Vision & Scope

Achieve fully automated, repeatable provisioning of the dvntm (mobile) substrate from bare metal to running services, with complete air-gap recovery capability.

**In Scope**
- Bare-metal provisioning (PXE, Ansible)
- Network infrastructure automation
- Image factory for all platforms
- Full air-gap rebuild capability

**Out of Scope**
- Application/tenant workload automation (separate per-tenant)
- Cloud infrastructure (this is on-prem only)

## Network Automation 🔄

Automated configuration of network infrastructure.

- ✅ Ansible Network Collection - DHCP reservations
- ✅ Ansible Network Collection - DNS host overrides
- 🔄 OPNsense Alternatives Evaluation
- 🔄 dvntm VLAN Plan
- ⏳ Access Switch Automation (Omada)
- ⏳ Proxmox Tenant Networking Design and Automation
- ⏳ Wireless AP Automation (Omada)
- ⏳ Migrate core router automation to OPNsense alternative
- ⏳ Document network build/rebuild steps in recovery plan

---

## Build Logging ⏳

Centralized logging during substrate provisioning.

- ⏳ Centralized build logging (aggregate logs from all phases)

---

## Full Substrate Rebuild Event ⏳

End-to-end rebuild of the mobile substrate from scratch. Validates full air-gap recovery capability. Completing this milestone signals the project is done.

- ⏳ Execute full substrate rebuild
- ⏳ Iterate on code and documentation fixes
- ⏳ Roadmap non-critical improvements for future work
