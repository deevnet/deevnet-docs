## Project Vision & Scope 🔄

Restore full, authentic use of vintage analog telephones by bridging them to modern Bluetooth cell phones — preserving rotary dialing, ringing behavior, tones, and user experience.

**In Scope**
- Rotary dial pulse detection
- Authentic ring, dial tone, busy/reorder tones
- Bluetooth HFP call handling
- Use of original phone and ringer hardware

**Out of Scope**
- VoIP provider integration
- Multi-line PBX features
- Smartphone UI replacement
