# Ma Bell Project

Bluetooth Phone Gateway for vintage telephone integration.

*Project implemented in a separate repository.*

- **GitHub:** https://github.com/cdeever/esp32-ma-bell-gateway
- **Documentation:** https://cdeever.github.io/esp32-ma-bell-gateway/

{{< overall-progress >}}

**Legend:** ✅ Complete | 🔄 In Progress | ⏳ Planned

## Project Vision & Scope 🔄

Restore full, authentic use of vintage analog telephones by bridging them to modern Bluetooth cell phones — preserving rotary dialing, ringing behavior, tones, and user experience.

**In Scope**
- Rotary dial pulse detection
- Authentic ring, dial tone, busy/reorder tones
- Bluetooth HFP call handling
- Use of original phone and ringer hardware

**Out of Scope**
- VoIP provider integration
- Multi-line PBX features
- Smartphone UI replacement

## Requirements & Constraints ⏳

Define what success means before building.

- ⏳ User scenarios (incoming/outgoing calls, edge cases)
- ⏳ Functional requirements (FR-xxx)
- ⏳ Non-functional requirements (latency, audio quality, reliability)
- ⏳ Electrical & mechanical constraints
- ⏳ Acceptance criteria for each requirement
- ⏳ Risk register (top technical risks + mitigations)

---

## Architecture & Design 🔄

Translate requirements into a complete system design.

- ⏳ System block diagram
- ⏳ Power architecture & protection strategy
- ⏳ Audio signal chain & gain staging plan
- ⏳ Hook switch, dial pulse, and ring detection design
- ⏳ Bluetooth integration architecture
- ⏳ Firmware architecture & state machine definition
- ⏳ Interface specifications (electrical, audio, software)
- ⏳ Verification & test plan (requirements → tests mapping)

---

## Proof of Concept / EVT ⏳

De-risk the hardest problems early using breadboards and bench tests.

- ⏳ Breadboard core signal chain
- ⏳ ESP32 bring-up & peripheral validation
