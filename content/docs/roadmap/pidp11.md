## Project Vision & Scope

Build a functional PDP-11 replica by assembling the PiDP-11 kit and running simh emulation, capable of running period-accurate operating systems with an authentic front panel experience.

**In Scope**
- PiDP-11 kit assembly and testing
- simh PDP-11 emulation on Raspberry Pi
- Front panel LED/switch integration
- Multiple OS support (RT-11, RSX-11, 2.11BSD)
- Baked image via deevnet-image-factory

**Out of Scope**
- Network connectivity for the emulated PDP-11
- Integration with modern systems
