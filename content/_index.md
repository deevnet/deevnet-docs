# Deevnet Infrastructure Platform

Deevnet is a collection of hardware, automation, and documentation for building reproducible on-premise infrastructure.

---

## Two Deployments

Deevnet consists of two hardware deployments:

### Deevnet Mobile (dvntm)

A **portable lab** that packs into a toolkit. Includes:

- Network infrastructure (router, switch, wireless AP)
- Compute nodes (Proxmox hypervisors, Raspberry Pis)
- Breadboards and components for embedded device prototyping
- Full on-premise network that can be set up anywhere

Deevnet Mobile provides a complete, self-contained environment for development, testing, and demos—whether at home, a coffee shop, or a Meetup site.

### Deevnet Home (dvnt)

A **home infrastructure** deployment supporting various functions:

- Permanent compute and storage
- Home automation and IoT backends
- Development and CI/CD environments
- Media and personal services

---

## Adaptability

While this project targets specific hardware, the patterns, automation, and documentation are designed to be **adaptable to any infrastructure**. The standards and architecture defined here can be applied to your own collection of devices and networks.

---

## Documentation Philosophy

This documentation exists to:
- seed context to AI agent tooling,
- make intent explicit,
- prevent knowledge from living only in someone's head,
- and ensure future changes remain coherent.

If something "works" but violates these documents, it is considered **incorrect**.
