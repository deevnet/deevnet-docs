# Deevnet Infrastructure Platform

Welcome to the authoritative documentation repository for the Deevnet ecosystem.

This repository captures shared standards, architectural intent, correctness definitions, roadmaps, platform and tooling decisions, and operational policies that apply across all Deevnet repositories.

## Design Philosophy

This repository exists to:
- make rebuilds boring,
- make intent explicit,
- prevent knowledge from living only in someone's head,
- and ensure future changes remain coherent.

If something "works" but violates these documents, it is considered **incorrect**.
